1) Frame rate was around 7-8 FPS. This was due to the number of times rendering was called (once per animation or sprite)
2) Changed it to be 1 draw call (batch up all vertices, indices and tex coords) + change from using GLByte to GlUInt for indices (too large). This resulted in around 25 FPS.
3) This previous change was hampered by the counting of how many sprites are there for each texture. When I keep a running total when adding and removing animations and sprites this went up to 50FPS. :)

Unrelated note : Use double for timesteps, simpler physics, anims and updates.
