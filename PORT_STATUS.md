#Arch
 - Works 100% :D

#Windows
 - Builds and works mostly
 - Bug (High): cog_anim lua crashes when run from command line luajit: WEIRD. Okay so it works when there is nothing in the main loop except for the cog_mainloop function. But breaks if you put a print in there, or a get, but not a repeated addition or something... SO WEIRD.
 - Bug (Low): Exit error code when run from IDE: Maybe okay?
