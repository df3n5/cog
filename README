To Compile
==========
Use cmake to build the project in a seperate directory.

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ../src
    make

To run tests:

    ./tests

The resultant library will be called libcog.a.

On Windows
==========
1) Install MSys + c compiler tool (w/ mingw-get-inst)
2) Install python27 + scons
3) Build cog using "scons", the dlls + exe will end up in the bin/ directory.

Sources used to build deps are up on dropbox.
