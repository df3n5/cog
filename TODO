TODO fermentedpoly
==================
 - Tiled importer working for objects
 - Groups working (collisions)
 - Tweens


TODO port
==============
 - Get working with cross compiler for OSX X

TODO general
==============
 - Think about using top-left coordinate system - this mimicks how files are read, how people read, etc. Maybe better then center-based as is currently?
 - Set media folder on init, so no need to type each time.
 - Good readable definition of all keycodes (enum?)
 - Normalisation of vectors built-in

Done Tasks cog
==============
1) Animation
 - Implement Map [done]
 - Use map and lists as data structures for sprites and animations [done]
2) Finish animation implementation.
    - Rendering in main loop.
3) Sound
4) Physics [MAYBE]
XXX) Function to take animation frame seq in.

3.25) Get list iteration more sensibly implemented. DONE
    -> Integrate FOREACH into cog and littleearth codebases.
3.5) Static frame rate for updates made easy for games.
5) Particle Effects [MAYBE]
6) Port lls to use it.
7) Software renderer (Meh, not sure if this will be needed/possible due to opengl being so much more powerful with rotations and somewhat, but leave in stubs for functions at the moment)
8) test for input.
 - Text wrapping function for cog_text and cog_text_multiline (maybe merge these 2?)
